  settings
- Implementing validation of node configuration

## Security Enhancements

### Role-Based Access Control

Add support for role-based access control to restrict access to
workflows and executions. This would involve:

- Adding a `list_roles` tool to list all roles
- Adding a `create_role` tool to create a new role
- Adding a `get_role` tool to retrieve a role
- Adding a `update_role` tool to update a role
- Adding a `delete_role` tool to delete a role
- Adding a `assign_role` tool to assign a role to a user
- Adding a `unassign_role` tool to unassign a role from a user

### Audit Logging

Add support for audit logging to track changes to workflows and
executions. This would involve:

- Adding a `get_audit_logs` tool to retrieve audit logs
- Supporting filtering of audit logs by user, action, resource, etc.

## Integration Enhancements

### Integration with Other MCP Servers

Add support for integrating with other MCP servers to enable more
complex automation scenarios. This would involve:

- Adding a `list_mcp_servers` tool to list all available MCP servers
- Adding a `connect_mcp_server` tool to connect to another MCP server
- Adding a `disconnect_mcp_server` tool to disconnect from an MCP
  server
- Implementing a mechanism for sharing data between MCP servers

### Integration with External Systems

Add support for integrating with external systems to enable more
complex automation scenarios. This would involve:
